# SwiftUICoordinator

Coordinator pattern is a design pattern commonly used in Swift/iOS apps that helps you manage navigation and flow between views in your application.
The idea is to keep views lightweight, decoupled and the app easier to maintain and extend over time.
This package represents a solution for integrating Coordinator pattern into the SwiftUI framework.

## Problem statement

In SwiftUI we miss navigating to root, one step back, dismissing in the middle of the stack or replacing a view.
